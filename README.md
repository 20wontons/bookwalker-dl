This tool is helps you make private copies of bookwalker books that are available publicly under the `viewer-trial` subdomain.  
It might work for other books too but that's not my goal here and probably doesn't work (it might with a few cookies and tweaks though).

The tool takes a cid (the UUID-like strings in the bookwalker URLs) as its only argument and prints the URLs to every page of the book in order. You can use a download tool of your choice to download the list.
